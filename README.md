# Calculator
A Calculator web-app to help flex my HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS skills.

Test it live at: https://shaunvandermey.github.io/Calculator/

This project uses HTML, CSS, and vanila JS to make a simple calculator. You can use the on-screen keys or the numpad on your keyboard to input into the calculator.

Of course, this webpage has some features built in. You're not allowed to divide by zero, the calculator rounds to 8 decimal places, and you'll only be able to evaluate one expression at a time.

I update this page with new features from time to time but mostly I try to work on new projects constantly.
